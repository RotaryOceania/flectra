Usage
=====

Define a member product, and select 'Fixed amount' or 'Percentage of the price'
for invoicing an extra charge in the first invoice that is created with this
member product.

By default, a line with the description *Membership initial fee*. If you want
to change this text, you can set a different sale description in the product
used for the fee.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add initial fee information to membership analysis.
* Add some criteria for adding initial fee:
   * Add initial fee if last membership ended x weeks/months/years ago
   * Add initial fee if last membership product_id is different
