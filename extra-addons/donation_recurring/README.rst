This module handles recurring donations. For example, if you have
setup a donation plan where donors can donate monthly via direct
debit, you can use this module in combination with the module
*account_banking_sepa_direct_debit* to organise your recurring donations.

Configuration
=============

In the menu *Donation > Donations > Recurring Donations*, create a
recurring donation template for each donor that commited to donate
monthly via direct debit.

If a donor ask to suspend it's recurring donation, click on the *Suspend* button. If he later asks to restart his recurring donations, click on the *Re-activate* button.

Usage
=====

Every month, execute the wizard *Generate Recurring Donations* : it will
duplicate each recurring donation template to create a regular donation.
Then select all these new draft donations generated by the wizard and
validate them.
